👋 Hi, I’m Eddy (hence my username e double-d y), a Software Engineer who specialises in testing blockchains 

👨‍💻 I work for [Mangata](https://mangata.finance), a [DEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_exchange), and previously for [IOHK](https://iohk.io) on [Cardano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardano_(blockchain_platform))

👀 I’m interested in building reliable software testing infrastructure and automated testing pipelines

🌱 I’m currently learning [data engineering](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) and [cloud devops](https://www.udacity.com/course/cloud-dev-ops-nanodegree--nd9991) with Udacity :)

✈️ I live between Palo Alto, CA, and Oxford, UK, with my wife [@SophieSchau](https://github.com/SophieSchau) and dog [Sudo](https://www.instagram.com/adognamedsudo/?hl=en)

🏄‍♂️ Outside of tech I enjoy video/board gaming, sports (gym, surfing), and cooking
